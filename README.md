## AI Assistance Disclosure

This project was created with help from **Replit AI** and **ChatGPT** to support development.  
Below is a clear breakdown of what was generated by AI and what I edited manually.

### AI Tools Used
- **Replit AI**  
  - Generated the initial HTML and CSS layout structure.
  - Helped create the responsive grid for the Projects and Skills sections.
  - Suggested improvements for UI styling, gradients, and animations.
  
- **ChatGPT**  
  - Refined the CSS for responsiveness, including media queries for mobile and tablets.
  - Provided the code for the Resume Download button and its placement.
  - Assisted in writing this README file and organizing the documentation.

### Manual Edits Done by Me
I personally edited and implemented:
- All text content, including my name, description, skills, and project details.
- Modified the color theme, spacing, and layout based on my preferences.
- Connected all navigation links and removed unused sections.
- Added my resume file and set the correct download path.
- Tested how responsive the site is across different screen sizes.
- Fixed alignment issues and improved the UI on mobile screens.
- Organized the final HTML and CSS structure and ensured everything works properly.

### Final Responsibility
All final design choices, content, and project organization were carried out by **me**,  
with AI tools used only as helpers, not as complete creators.
